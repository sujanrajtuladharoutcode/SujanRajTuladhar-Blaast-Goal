# Deploying Python Lambda Functions Using AWS CDK with TypeScript

## Introduction

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is a powerful tool that enables developers to define cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages. In this guide, we will explore how to use AWS CDK with TypeScript to deploy Python Lambda functions on AWS.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js and npm**: You can install these from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **AWS CLI**: Follow the instructions in the [AWS CLI User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) to install and configure it.
- **AWS CDK**: Install it globally using npm:

  ```sh
  npm install -g aws-cdk
  ```

## 1. Understanding CDK Fundamentals

AWS CDK uses three primary concepts:

- **Constructs**: Basic building blocks of AWS CDK that represent AWS resources.
- **Stacks**: Collections of constructs that AWS CloudFormation deploys as a single unit.
- **CDK CLI**: Command-line interface for managing AWS CDK projects.

### Learning Resources

- **Official Documentation**: [AWS CDK Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html)
- **Tutorials**:
  - [AWS CDK Workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/)
  - [AWS CDK Examples](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples)
- **Articles**: Search for recent blog posts and articles on AWS CDK for additional insights and use cases.

## 2. Setting Up Development Environment

### Required Tools

- **Node.js and npm**: Install from the [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).
- **AWS CLI**: Install and configure following the [AWS CLI User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).
- **AWS CDK**: Install globally using npm:

  ```sh
  npm install -g aws-cdk
  ```

### IDE Configuration

- Use an IDE like VSCode with TypeScript support.
- Install TypeScript globally:

  ```sh
  npm install -g typescript
  ```

### Initializing a New CDK Project

1. Create a new directory for your project:

    ```sh
    mkdir my-cdk-project
    cd my-cdk-project
    ```

2. Initialize a new CDK project in TypeScript:

    ```sh
    cdk init app --language typescript
    ```

## 3. Defining CDK Stacks

### Basic CDK Stack Definition

- Open `lib/my-cdk-project-stack.ts` and define your stack:

  ```typescript
  import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
  import * as lambda from '@aws-cdk/aws-lambda';

  export class MyCdkProjectStack extends cdk.Stack {
    constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
      super(scope, id, props);

      // Define a new Lambda resource
      new lambda.Function(this, 'MyLambdaFunction', {
        runtime: lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
        handler: 'index.handler',
        code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda')
      });
    }
  }
  ```

### Experimenting with Constructs

- Explore different constructs such as S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, etc.
- Refer to the [AWS CDK API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/) for details on available constructs.

## 4. Creating Python Lambda Functions

### Writing Lambda Functions

1. Create a `lambda` directory in your project root.
2. Inside `lambda`, create a file `index.py`:

    ```python
    def handler(event, context):
        print("Hello from Lambda!")
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': 'Hello from Lambda!'
        }
    ```

### Testing Locally

- Use tools like `pytest` to write unit tests for your Lambda function.
- Example test in `test_lambda.py`:

    ```python
    import index

    def test_handler():
        result = index.handler({}, {})
        assert result['statusCode'] == 200
        assert result['body'] == 'Hello from Lambda!'
    ```

## 5. CDK Deployment

### Building and Synthesizing

- Run the following command to build and synthesize the CDK stack:

  ```sh
  cdk synth
  ```

### Deploying to AWS

- Deploy the stack to your AWS account:

  ```sh
  cdk deploy
  ```

### Verifying Deployment

- Check the AWS Management Console to verify the deployed Lambda function.
- Test the Lambda function using the console or AWS CLI.
