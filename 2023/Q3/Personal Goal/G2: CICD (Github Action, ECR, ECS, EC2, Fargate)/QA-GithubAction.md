# Quality Assurance Backend Workflow using GitHub Actions: A Detailed Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of setting up a Quality Assurance (QA) backend workflow using GitHub Actions. The workflow is designed to ensure code quality, perform testing, and validate the backend application using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow is triggered by two events: when a pull request is opened or updated, and when it is manually triggered.

### Steps

1. **Checkout Code:** The workflow starts by checking out the code from your repository using the `actions/checkout` action.
2. **Copy Environment File:** The QA environment file is copied to the appropriate location to ensure the correct environment settings.
3. **Build Test Images:** The Docker image for the Django application is built using `docker-compose`.
4. **Run Django Application:** The Docker container for the Django application is started using `docker-compose`.
5. **Run Test Cases:** Test cases for the Django application are executed using `docker-compose exec`.

## Prerequisites

* A GitHub repository containing the backend codebase.
* Docker and Docker Compose installed on the runner environment.

## Workflow Configuration

Create a file named `.github/workflows/qa_backend.yml` in your repository. Add the following content to configure the GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Quality Assurance Backend

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
    workflow_call:

jobs:
  test:
    name: Quality Assurance Backend
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Copy Environment file
        run: |
          cp apps/backend/QA.env apps/backend/.env

        - name: Build test images
          run: |
            cd apps/backend/
            docker-compose build django

        - name: Run Django
          run: |
            cd apps/backend/
            docker-compose up -d django

        - name: Run test cases
          run: |
            cd apps/backend/
            docker-compose exec -i django python manage.py test
```

## Usage

1. Clone your GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure your AWS credentials are properly configured or you have the required permissions to download files from AWS S3.
3. Customize the workflow configuration by modifying environment variables, paths, or any other necessary details.
4. Push your changes to the GitHub repository.
5. To trigger the workflow:
    * Open or update a pull request to the `main` branch.
    * Manually trigger the workflow by navigating to the "Actions" tab and selecting "Run workflow" for the "Quality Assurance Backend" workflow.
6. Monitor the workflow's progress in the "Actions" tab. Review the logs to identify any issues or errors.

## Customization

* Adjust the test cases section to match your application's test suite.
* Customize the `docker-compose.yml` file in your backend application to fit your requirements.
* Extend the workflow for deployment steps if needed.

## Important Notes

* This guide provides a basic example; you can expand and adapt it to your specific project needs.
