# AWS Command Line Documentation

## Introduction

The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) provides a powerful and flexible command-line tool for interacting with various AWS services. This documentation covers essential AWS CLI commands for managing Amazon S3 buckets and objects.

## Installation

Ensure the AWS CLI is installed on your machine. Follow the official [AWS CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) for detailed instructions.

## Configuration

Configure the AWS CLI with your AWS credentials and default region using the following command:

```bash
aws configure
```

## S3 Operations

S3 operations are defined on [Fundamental of S3 Buckets](1\)%20Fundamental%20of%20S3%20Buckets%20.md) and [Working with Buckets, Folders, and Objects](2\)%20Working%20with%20Buckets,%20Folders,%20and%20Objects.md)

## Best Practices
